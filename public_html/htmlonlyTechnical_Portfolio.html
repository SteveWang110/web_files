                Delivered Data Processing Project in Java that processes a high volume of data containing all US cities to show which states have
                the most cities, and all cities within a state. The project uses the perfect hashing method which reduces memory usage.
                <p></p>
                Developed an Image Trimming Project in C++ that only trimmed unimportant pixels based on their RGB values. 
                <p></p>
                Created simulated CPU on Logism using y86 architecture. This CPU is able to do arithmetic operations, jump instructions, and store
                values in registers and memory. This CPU is able to compute simple c++ code that is inputted into the CPU as binary files.

                I have been doing programming projects online through  <a href="https://leetcode.com/">LeetCode</a>, a website that allows
                you to train and improve your coding skills. Also, this year I will be doing many more programming projects, including Projects
                in OpenGl, a graphics design software, as well as website projects in HTML.
