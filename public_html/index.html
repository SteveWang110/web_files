            I am currently a student at Texas A&M pursuing a computer science degree.
             Currently, I am enrolled in several high-level programming courses, and I
              have learned so much about my major. From algorithms to graphics to websites, 
              I have enjoyed all these aspects of computer science. However, in the future,
               if I could choose a specialty in CS, I would like to be a programmer dealing 
               with  <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/artificial-intelligence-ai.asp">AI</a> technology. I am very passionate about coding, and I continuously 
               make efforts to become a better programmer. For example, in my free time, 
               sometimes I’ll decide to do a few coding problems on LeetCode, just to keep
                my technical skills fresh. I do this because I love the feeling of figuring 
                out ways to solve problems, since I am a very analytical and competitive
                 person. Also, I have a coding background in multiple programming languages,
                  and I adapt and learn new coding languages quickly.
                  <p></p>
            While I don’t have any outstanding achievements yet, I am proud of the fact 
            that I am learning so much about programming in my CS courses. Also, I think that
             I’m really good in team oriented projects, and am someone that believes that 
             being nice and respectful goes a long way in making team projects go smoothly. 
             Furthermore, my desire for a steady schedule and workflow has helped teams 
             that I have been in the past to keep up with the work and not fall behind. 
             There are a few professional goals that I want to achieve in the future. 
             First, I’d like to be an intern for a tech company this upcoming summer, 
             as I’d love to see what corporate culture is all about, and I also want 
             to improve my technical skills whether that be coding or team skills.  
             Eventually, I want to pursue a career in AI programming at a major 
             tech company and I am working hard towards this goal. To the left is my dog
