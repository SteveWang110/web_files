            I am currently a  <a href="https://engineering.tamu.edu/electrical/admissions-and-aid/scholarships-aid/graduate/teaching-assistant-application.html">Teaching Assistant</a> at Texas A&M University. While this is a job, 
    and I get paid for it, I absolutely love helping undergraduate students struggling 
    in engineering courses. I try my best to help those that need help, and am elated 
    when my advice benefits them.

    I have gone to church ever since I was a little kid, and often there were volunteer 
    opportunities available. For example, one of the most notable volunteering I have 
    done was helping people rebuild houses that were damaged by Hurricane Harvey back 
    in 2017. Some other volunteering I did include helping out at the Houston Food Bank,
     where we prepared lunches for kids, as well as multiple different fundraisers for 
     children.

    In the summer of 2021, I worked for a company called <a href="https://www.ricetec.com/">RiceTec</a>, and worked a full-time
     summer job for 3 months, with 40 hour weeks. This job helped me learn how to manage
      my time efficiently, because an 8-5 job is a huge time commitment, so I had to 
      learn how to use my time wisely. My role in this company was an assistant 
      scientist, as I collected samples of plant DNA, and I also managed the greenhouse,
       keeping the plants alive and cross breeding them.
